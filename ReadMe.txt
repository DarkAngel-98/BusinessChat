Business Chat
Documentation

This application is simple way to connect with all the people that are using this application. 
Communication with users is made very simple without having to search for any particular user. 
This means you can contact every person on the contacts list. 
The main purpose of this application is to make exchanging business cards and chat as simple as possible. 
You can exchange your business card with some random user and show them what your company is, what is your name, your phone number and your profile picture. 
Every action is done in real time using Firebase Database as a service to transfer messages and every other information.
1. The First thing you see when you install this application is the logo screen. 
After the logo screen goes away, you (as user) are prompted to choose between register and login. 	
If this is your first time using this application, you must first register. So, by clicking on the register button you will be navigated to the Register scene. 
Here, you need to write your first name, last name, username, password, mobile phone, company name, home address (which is optional) and email address. 
Make sure to remember your email and your password. When you feel like your info is good enough, you can press the Register button. 
If the information you provided are legal (and all of the required fields are filled), you will be navigated to Home Screen. 				
If this is not your first time using this application, you can press the login 
button and will be navigated to the Login screen where you need to provide your email and your password. 
If your provided informations are correct, you will be navigated to the Home screen.

2. At Home screen, you can feel like home. Here, at the top, you can see how your own business card looks like. 
Also, you can find informations you have provided when you registered and at the bottom, you can see the logout button. When pressed, 
logout button will ask you if you are sure you want to logout.

3. After you passed the first step and successfully registered/logged in, you can now see all the users that are using this application. 
You can achieve this by pressing the second (in the middle) button on the navigation panel. 
Once you got here, you can see which users are online and which users are not. 
By clicking on any user you will be asked if you want to chat with this person or send him message card. 						
If you choose the Chat option, you will be navigated to Chat scene and you can chat with this person. Is that easy. 								
If you choose the second option: Card, you will see small screen with your card. You can click send button and that card will be sent to the person you have chosen. 
Also, you can edit your edit card and change some important informations about yourself and only then you can send your business card. 
Bear in mind that if you edit your e-mail address, this is only your new contact address. This IS NOT your address that you can use to login into your account. 
Your login address stays the same. 	

4. Once you sent your first message or your first business card, the person you have chosen to communicate with, will receive notification for your actions. 
So, always make sure to be polite when writing a message to another person and to provide legal (as much as possible) informations about yourself. 
For example, provide legal e-mail and mobile phone for contact, provide legal (and of course be honest) company name because it is possible that 
some person will contact you just because of your working company. 	Now, if some person decides to write a massage to you, you will receive notification 
and by clicking on that notification you will be navigated to your Home screen. 
This is considered as starting screen. From here, you can navigate to Users screen, and you will notice red message icon next to the person who sent you message. 
Now, you can click on that person and choose to chat and you will enter the Chat screen again and can start communicating with this user. 							
Or, if some person decides to send you a business card, you will receive notification. 
By clicking on the notification, you will be also navigated to Home screen and form there, by clicking on the last button from the navigation panel, 
you will be navigated to Business Card scene where you can see all business cards that have been sent to you. 
From here, you can easily see contact informations from people who sent you business card. 
Now, you can choose to contact those people (or that person) or you can just ignore these business cards. 
If you want to ask specific person for his other informations that are not provided on the business card, you can easily find this person in the Users scene. 
If you want to logout, navigate to home screen and press the logout button located on the bottom of your screen. 								
Make sure not to be rude when communicating with other people and asking questions. This application can only be useful when used right.
